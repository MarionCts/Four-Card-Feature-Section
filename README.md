## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge was to build out a feature section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

### Solution retrospective

For this challenge, I wanted to practice a responsive approach by using the clamp property for text and margin-block/margin-inline instead of the traditional margin-bottom/margin-left properties. This is particularly useful when a page needs to be translated into a right-to-left (RTL) language, for example.

I had a bit of trouble understanding how the clamp property works, but I managed to figure it out and I got the result to be as close as possible to the original design.

I would be grateful for any kind of feedback!
